Transfer Learning with VGG16

This project demonstrates how to use Transfer Learning with the VGG16 architecture for image classification. Instead of training a model from scratch, we leverage the pre-trained VGG16 model (trained on ImageNet) to extract powerful features and fine-tune it for a custom dataset.

📌 Project Overview

Uses VGG16 as the base model.

Two approaches are demonstrated:

Feature Extraction → Freeze convolutional layers and train only the classifier.

Fine-Tuning → Unfreeze some top convolutional layers for better adaptation.

Works for binary and multi-class image classification tasks.

🛠️ Requirements

Make sure you have the following installed:

pip install tensorflow keras matplotlib numpy


Optional (if using PyTorch):

pip install torch torchvision

🚀 Usage
1. Prepare Dataset

Organize your dataset in the following format:

data/
  train/
    class1/
    class2/
  val/
    class1/
    class2/

2. Run Training

Example (Keras):

from tensorflow.keras.applications import VGG16
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, Flatten
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.image import ImageDataGenerator

# Load VGG16 without top classifier
base_model = VGG16(weights="imagenet", include_top=False, input_shape=(224,224,3))
base_model.trainable = False  # Freeze base

# Build new model
model = Sequential([
    base_model,
    Flatten(),
    Dense(256, activation='relu'),
    Dense(2, activation='softmax')  # Change to match your classes
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])


Then train with your data generators.

📊 Results

Feature extraction gives good results with small datasets.

Fine-tuning improves performance if more data is available.

Pre-trained weights reduce training time and improve accuracy.

🔮 Future Work

Experiment with other pre-trained models (ResNet, Inception, MobileNet).

Add data augmentation for better generalization.

Deploy model with Flask/FastAPI or convert to TensorFlow Lite for mobile apps.
